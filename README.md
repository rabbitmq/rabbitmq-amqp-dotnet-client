# RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 .NET Client

This library is in early stages of development. It is meant to be used with RabbitMQ 4.0.

## How to Run

- Start the broker with `./.ci/ubuntu/gha-setup.sh start`. Note that this has been tested on Ubuntu 22 with docker.
- Run the tests with ` dotnet test ./Build.csproj  --logger "console;verbosity=detailed" /p:AltCover=true`
- Stop RabbitMQ with `./.ci/ubuntu/gha-setup.sh stop`
